# Programming Foundations
This is a workbook for getting hands-on with some basic statements common to most modern programming languages. It is written in Kotlin, and uses the more commmon statements rather than Kotlin specific statements.

## Instructions
Open [WorkbookTest](src/test/kotlin/net/designed4device/programming/foundations/WorkbookTest.kt) and follow the instructions included. Make all changes in [Workbook](src/main/kotlin/net/designed4device/programming/foundations/Workbook.kt)
